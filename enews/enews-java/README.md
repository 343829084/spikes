The idea is to parse our #general channel for all posts that have the #eNews hashtag in a time range (1 week).

We'd then generate a newsletter from this feed.

Perhaps the newsletter will have different sections.

So far we have a `slack-scraper` module
 - This will return a json object that contains the information for a timeframe

TODO

Module to post this newsletter to slack?
Module to post this newsletter to email?
