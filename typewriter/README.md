A simple object relational mapper on top of Android's [Cursor][1] and [ContentProvider][2].

## Description

The aim of `typewriter` is to bring type safety to untyped Android APIs.

At the moment this is work-in-progress in a early stage, so only type safety on top of [Cursor][1] has been implemented, but the long term goal is to add types to other classes, such as [Intent][3] for example.

The main class is `CursorList` which is an implementation of a `List` that acts as a typed lazy list on a `Cursor`, allowing you to iterate over large data sets from the DB. `CursorList` implements `Closeable`, meaning you need to close it once you're done with it (this will close the `Cursor`).


## Adding to your project

To start using this library, add these lines to the `build.gradle` of your project:

```groovy
repositories {
  jcenter()
}

dependencies {
  compile 'com.novoda:typewriter:0.0.3'
}
```


## Simple usage

Here is a simple example that shows how to get a list of contacts from the contacts list in an Android device:

First create the class that models the object:

```java
public class Contact {
    public String display_name;
    public String last_time_contacted;

    public Contact() {
    }
}
```

Then query for the data you need:

```java
Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null);
```

And voil√†, you've got the typed list from the `Cursor`:

```java
CursorList<Contact> typedCursor = new CursorList<Contact2>(cursor, Contact.class);
for (Contact c : typedCursor) {
  Log.i("TEST", c.display_name + " " + c.last_time_contacted);
}
typedCursor.close();
```
