Palette similar under L Spike
======

This is a Spike to use a similar functionality as Palette API, as it is still unavailable in minSdkVersion under L.
It allows you to get main, secondary and tertiary colors from an image.
Most of the code has been took from [Chris Banes post](http://chris.banes.me/2014/02/18/colour-matching/) and the asssociated [gist](https://gist.github.com/chrisbanes/ba8e7b9ec0e40f6949c6)

TODO :

- Avoid crashes when image is null.
- Handle orientation
