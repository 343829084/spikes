Slacker
===

## Set up

In order to run Slacker locally you'll need to have node (and npm) installed. If you don't, go do it now! 

To run the server, first make sure you have all the dependencies installed by running `npm install` under the "slacker" dir.

As soon as all the dependencies are installed just type `npm start` into your terminal.
